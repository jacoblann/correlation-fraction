# Simulation test on relationship between Average Correlation and Fraction of Variance Explained by PC

corr_pc1_simulation.py and simulationJSE.py is based on Alec Kercheval's simulation code, compute Average Correlation and Fraction of Variance Explained by PC.

For both one-factor and multi-factor models.

Really appreciate Professor Kercheval's great work!
