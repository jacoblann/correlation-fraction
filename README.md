# Simulation test on relationship between Average Correlation and Fraction of Variance Explained by PC

Based on Alec Kercheval's simulation code, compute Average Correlation and Fraction of Variance Explained by PC.

Both one-factor model and multi-factor models.

Really appreciate Professor Kercheval's great work!
